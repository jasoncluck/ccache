#Cloud Cache

Cloud cache is a library for sharing memory across compute nodes.  It utilizes a simpler version of the memcached protocol.  While currently running on the Linux kernel, the goal is to implement this on [Composite](git@github.com:gparmer/Composite.git), a component-based operating system.

This code is under development at this time and unstable.  I'll add more information once this is closer to deployment.

Feel free to send me questions at jcluck@gwmail.gwu.edu.
